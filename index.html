        <p><b>Ride Operator:</b> Over this past Summer I worked at a local amusment park in Hope New Jersey called the Land of

            assisting them on if needed. Along with this I sold merchandise at the park on occasion. Through this I learned
            how to properly communicate with people to properly run the day to day operations of a buisness. This also taught
            how to properly communicate with customers and try to meet their needs with the best of my abilities.
